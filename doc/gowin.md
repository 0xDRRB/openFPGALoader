# Gowin notes

## GOWIN GW1N (Trenz TEC0117, Sipeed Tang Nano, Honeycomb and RUNBER)

*.fs* file is the default format generated by *Gowin IDE*, so nothing
special must be done to generates this file.

Since the same file is used for SRAM and Flash a CLI argument is used to
specify the destination.

### Flash SRAM

with **-m**

```bash
openFPGALoader -m -b BOARD_NAME impl/pnr/*.fs
```
where *BOARD_NAME* is:
- *tec0117*
- *tangnano*
- *runber*

### Flash (only with Trenz TEC0117 and runber):

with **-f**

__file load__:
```bash
openFPGALoader -f -b BOARD_NAME impl/pnr/*.fs
```
where *BOARD_NAME* is:
- **tec0117**
- **runber**
